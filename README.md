# Resources
## Material Science
1. A good introduction to thermoplasticity: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785319343858. We may explore this area as it enables us to control stiffness through electric means. Let's read more.
2. It is good to read more about some of the recent publications in soft haptics, such as these papers https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7523806 and https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/5712/innovative-haptic-interfaces-emerging-from-soft-robotics or these groups: http://www.jaist.ac.jp/ms/labs/vanho/index-e.html and https://helge-wurdemann.com/softhapticslab/  
3. A general introduction to computational materials science is also great to read about. There are plenty of resources about it, such as: https://avs.scitation.org/doi/10.1116/1.4813689.
4. A good textbook: https://www.cambridge.org/ae/academic/subjects/engineering/materials-science/introduction-computational-materials-science-fundamentals-applications?format=HB
